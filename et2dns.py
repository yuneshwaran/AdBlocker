# https://github.com/tweedge/emerging-threats-pihole
#
# Category: {}
# Description: {}
# Utility: {}
# Status: Beta / in development
# Last modified: {}
#
# WHAT:
# This blocklist is intended for use in PiHole or similar DNS-level filters. It's generated automatically from part of
# the current Emerging Threats Open ruleset, which is threat intelligence and signatures provided by the Emerging
# Threats research team and contributed to by security researchers around the world.
#
# TECHNICAL NOTICE:
# While this list provides some DNS filtering coverage, the provided filter is NOT comparable to protection offered by
# Emerging Threats' signatures when implemented in an IPS such as Snort or Suricata. This is because IDS can perform
# advanced matching functionality and make bypassing the filter much more difficult. Some key examples:
#  * If a particular strain of malware queries the public DNS resolver 8.8.8.8 directly, this could bypass PiHole on
#    your network.
#  * Emerging Threats includes much more than blocking specific domains, such as detecting and blocking DNS
#    exfiltration attacks based on different parts of the DNS payload that PiHole would simply ignore.
#  * And of course, Emerging Threats covers 100s of different protocols with their signatures, extending FAR beyond
#    DNS! This allows researchers to write very specific rules to detect and block threats at the network level,
#    making it harder for malware or threats to hide from security staff by just changing what domain they use.
# After all, a domain can cost only a few dollars - but re-engineering your custom malware implant could take days!
#
# WHY:
# First, of course I hope this can help you keep some malware/unwanted traffic/etc. off your network!
# Second, for folks interested in cybersecurity (personal or career) that you get a glimpse of some new technology
# that you may not have heard of before and something fun to learn about - or maybe contribute to in the future! :)
